# Chain of Lands – Governance Model

## 1. Purpose of Governance

Governance in Chain of Lands exists to protect the long-term integrity
of the world, not to maximize short-term influence.

The goal is not to decentralize everything immediately,
but to decentralize **what should not be controlled by a single entity**.

Governance is treated as a gradual evolution,
aligned with the maturity of the ecosystem and its community.

---

## 2. Core Governance Principles

All governance mechanisms are guided by the following principles:

- No absolute authority
- No permanent dominance
- No irreversible control
- No narrative contradiction

Power within Chain of Lands is intentionally fragmented
to prevent capture, stagnation, or collapse.

## 3. Governance Scope

Governance applies to specific categories of decisions.
Not all aspects of the project are governed in the same way.

### Governable Domains

- Narrative direction (high-level)
- Seasonal structure and transitions
- Faction balance adjustments
- Introduction of new lands or factions
- Systemic rule changes

### Non-Governable Domains

- Canonical foundations of the lore
- Historical events already recorded
- Core architectural principles
- Security-critical infrastructure

Some elements must remain stable
for the world to remain coherent.

## 4. Narrative Governance

Narrative governance is one of the defining aspects of Chain of Lands.

Participants do not vote on individual storylines.
They influence **directions, tensions, and outcomes**.

Examples include:
- Escalation or resolution of conflicts
- Emergence of new threats
- Decline or rise of factions
- Shifts in world balance

Eru AI acts as a narrative mediator,
ensuring all outcomes remain canon-consistent.

## 5. Community Participation

Participation is earned through alignment and contribution,
not instant access.

Forms of participation may include:
- Long-term presence
- Constructive contributions
- Lore involvement
- Ecosystem support

Governance influence is not designed to be purely transactional.

The system favors continuity over speculation.

---

## 6. Progressive Decentralization

Chain of Lands does not launch as a fully decentralized system.

Instead, it follows a staged decentralization model:

### Stage I – Curated Governance
- Core team stewardship
- Community feedback loops
- Observation and calibration

### Stage II – Hybrid Governance
- Limited community decision-making
- Narrative and seasonal input
- Experimental governance tools

### Stage III – Community-Led Governance
- Expanded decision authority
- Formalized participation mechanisms
- DAO-aligned structures

Progression between stages is not time-based,
but readiness-based.

## 7. Faction Representation

Factions may eventually act as governance entities.

Faction-based governance may include:
- Representation through alignment
- Collective influence over narrative outcomes
- Participation in balance discussions

Faction dominance does not imply total control.
All power remains bounded.

---

## 8. Safeguards & Constraints

To prevent governance abuse,
the following safeguards are enforced:

- Hard limits on influence accumulation
- Narrative canon validation
- Time-delayed decisions
- Reversibility where possible

No decision is intended to permanently destabilize the world.

---

## 9. Transparency & Record Keeping

All governance-relevant decisions should be:
- Documented
- Traceable
- Reviewable

Where applicable, records may be:
- Stored off-chain
- Anchored on-chain
- Reflected through Eru’s memory system

Governance without memory is authority without accountability.

---

## 10. Governance Failures

Failure is anticipated and designed for.

If governance mechanisms:
- Become inactive
- Are exploited
- Produce harmful outcomes

The system allows for:
- Temporary intervention
- Structural revision
- Governance resets under strict conditions

Preserving the world takes priority over preserving process.

---

## 11. Future DAO Transition

A DAO structure is considered a potential outcome,
not a prerequisite.

Any DAO implementation must:
- Respect narrative consistency
- Protect long-term participants
- Avoid plutocratic capture

Decentralization is not treated as a goal by itself,
but as a tool to preserve fairness and continuity.

---

## Closing Statement

Governance in Chain of Lands is not about control.

It is about **stewardship**.

The world does not belong to those who act the fastest,
but to those who remain the longest.
